This project was initiated to try out my ability in using stacked LSTM for multiple parralel input data. The challenge in this project lies in that, twenty cryptocurrencies
data were processed and trained togehter to make prediction and eventually forecast.
Although there were limitations, it indeed open widen my view on the challenges of neural network and after which I had successfully built, train and optimize LSTM model,
CNN-LSTM model, Attention-based LSTM model and CNN-LSTM with attention mechanism.
